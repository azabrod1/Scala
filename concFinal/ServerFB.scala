	   * Precondition- buffer is empty 
	   * 
	   * Purpose-      For each enqueued producer, see if a consumer exists that can take its value.
	   * 						   If yes, deposit that producer's value and immediately let that consumer take it
	   * 						 	 If no,  leave that producer in the queue for now and try the same with next one
	   * 							 The idea is to try to match all the pairs of waiting producers-consumers we can.
	   * 							 This is a more advanced version of a buffer with conditions because here we 
	   * 						   use our stored knowledge to wake up the right threads instead of just
	   * 						   letting randomness dictate which thread is awakened (as the case with conditions)
	   * 
	   * Postcondition- None of producers and consumers remaining on the queues or in the buffer can
	   * 								possibly match. No more meaningful progress can be made. If there are values on
	   * 								the producer queue, there must also be a value in the buffer (as we must adhere
	   * 								to the abstract interface we are implementing!)

	   *    currently queued up can accept the values from any of the producers currently queued up. This second rule is maintained by
	   *  	the matching() function when a consumer takes a value
	   *  
	   *  
	   *  Consumer: An arriving consumer can't do anything if the current value on the buffer is not accepted by its filter or 
	   *  if the buffer is empty (and by invariant a, producer queue is empty also). The consumer thus can only
	   *  make progress if the buffer has a value it can consume. In this case, it consumes the value and we call the matching function
	   *  which makes sure to select a producer from the queue whose value can be consumed by one of the consumers on the queue. If
	   *  on such producer is found, the producer deposits its value and the value is quickly consumed by the chosen consumer. We repeat this
	   *  until no meaningful progress can be made (invariant b holds). At the end of matching(), if producers exist that could not be matched,
	   *  the first one on the queue is allowed to deposit its value anyway to maintain invariant a). 
	   *  
	   *  Producer: If a producer arrives and there is already a value on the buffer, no meaningful progress can be made
	   *  If there is no value on the buffer, by invariant a) there are also no producers on the producer queue. Thus
	   *  the producer can put its value in the buffer and check if there are any consumers queued up that would 
	   *  accept its value. Thus, the producer deposits its value if and only if the buffer is empty when it arrives
